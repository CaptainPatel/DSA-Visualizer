# 📊 DSA Visualizer — Recursive Algorithms with Graphviz

A Python project to **visualize recursion** in classic **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems using **Graphviz**. Ideal for both learning recursion and showcasing algorithmic thinking visually!

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Visual representation of **recursive call stack**
- 🎨 Styled recursion trees with **Graphviz**
- 🧠 Helps understand the **flow of recursion** step-by-step
- 🧪 Easily extendable to other DSA problems (e.g., Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Current Algorithm Implemented

- **Factorial (Recursive)**  
  Visualizes the tree of recursive factorial calls  
  (e.g. `factorial(4)` ➝ 4 → 3 → 2 → 1)


## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**  

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Visualizer.git
cd DSA-Visualizer

**Install Graphviz**

Download and install from: https://graphviz.org/download/

Add Graphviz’s /bin directory to your system PATH.

**Install Python dependencies**
pip install graphviz

**Run the visualizer**
python main.py


## 🧰 Tech Stack
